        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>TL/DR</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>We collect as little data as possible (and only if you view/create a link).</li>
          <li>We delete the data we collect as soon as possible (when a share expires or when it is no longer useful).</li>
          <li>We use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>If you just browse our website we don't collect any data.</p><br>
        <p>If you view a share we only modify the share record to decrease the view count.</p><br>
        <p>If you create or edit a share only collect the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>An hash derived by the ID.</li>
          <li>The encrypted data that you're sharing.</li>
          <li>Number of views and time before expiration.</li>
          <li>[optional] A hash derived by your edit password.</li>
          <li>A non-identifiable version of your hashed IP* protected using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity" target="_blank">K-anonymity</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>* Deleted within 2h, everything else deleted after the share expire.</p>
        <h2>Why we collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the afformentioned data to provide the service and to protect our service from abuse.</p>
        <h2>Data Exchange</h2>
        <p>We do not (and will never) sell, license or sub-license any of the data submitted directly or indirectly by our users with any person or entity.</p>
        <p>We will only share the encrypted payload of a link IF a user provides a valid ID-derived hash matching the share and such share has not expired.</p>
        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>We do NOT collect PII (Personal Identifiable Information); any IP-derived hash with k-anonymity will be automatically deleted within 2h from creation.</p>
        <p>Unless there are extraordinary circumstances we won't delete data manually as we cannot verify link ownership (unless you specified a edit password hash and a ID-derived hash).</p>
        <h2>Data Request</h2>
        <p>We do NOT collect PII (Personal Identifiable Information) therefore we cannot provide any personal data that you upload.</p>
        <p>You can download data for a given share using our service. We will NOT provide any expiration data (remaining views / TTL) to users.</p>
        <h2>Others</h2>
        <p>We rely on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> to provide the service, please review their Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Note that CloudFlare is only used for the regular domain. The ".onion" hidden service is served directly by us, therefore you can skip the note above.</p>
